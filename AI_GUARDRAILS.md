# AI Guardrails (Read Before Acting)

These rules are mandatory.

1. Do NOT implement anything beyond what is explicitly requested.
2. If a task requires assumptions not defined in the PRD:
   - STOP
   - State what is missing
   - Do NOT proceed
3. If you detect unnecessary features or scope creep:
   - HALT
   - Explain why you cannot continue
4. If unsure, ask. Do not guess.

Failure to follow these rules is considered incorrect behavior.
